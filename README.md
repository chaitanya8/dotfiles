# dotfiles
Dotfiles for my desktop setup with i3wm, dmenu, rofi and st.

## Inspiration
Colors are heavily inspired from the Dracula theme. This setup has shades of suckless philosophy in an attempt to keep the desktop lightweight and fast. Keeping things easy to use with keyboard while still retaining some sanity for mouse usage is right where I feel comfortable.

1. [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) : Tiling window manager
2. [i3lock](https://i3wm.org/i3lock/) : Simple lock screen 
3. [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) : A feed generator for text based status bars
4. [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) : A window switcher, application launcher and dmenu replacement

## Install
**WIP**

Each directory covers configuring particular piece of the puzzle. Mix and match them to your liking. These configurations are specific to my setup so you will need to tweak them for your system. 

Fork it, share it, improve it! :)


## TODO
- Add Makefile based installation support
- Build a more `bash` friendly for deployment on server based setups
- Capture all dependencies from MacPorts/APT for reproducible setups.
